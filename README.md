# A Fetch API and Modular approach demo: A Complete Employee Directory Site

  - Eventually, this will be adapted to be a how-to tutorial

  - this was originally built as part of TeamTreehouse, Tech Degree, Full Stack JavaScript

## Places to Start

  - So this project demonstrates an implementation of some fairly advanced programing:
    - Fetch API,
    - Module pattern using javascript Closures
    - Modal dialog (***not a pop-ups***)
    - Handling all UI events with CSS only


  - Doing this all in the same project, requires **skill and patience**
    - The plan is to break these down into simpler steps


  - While I rewrite this, here are some places to get you started
    - after working through the following links, the code in this project should be a bit more self-explanatory 

### Fetch API

  - [Start here, for information on the Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)

### The Module Pattern
